## Overview

A simple single card component.

Styles are built using sass (dart sass syntax) via the commandline to keep things really simple.

I trialled a [very new CSS reset](https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) in this project that is adapted from those by Andy Bell and Josh Comeau. I like how it uses `:where` to reduce CSS specificity but had to adapt its use of block-size to prevent a bug where the content was being cropped on small screens.

## My process

1. Project set up
2. HTML
3. Scss

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS logical properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CSS reset](https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) - To baseline cross-browser styles
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Dart sass syntax

### What I learned

It was interesting trialling `:where` in this CSS reset, and getting more comfortable with the newish (to me) Dart Sass syntax. I will continue to use both, although I believe the CSS reset needs further tweaks and testing to make it less opinionated and ready for use in my production projects
